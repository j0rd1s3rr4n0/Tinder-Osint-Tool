## üìç Overview

This project is an extension for chromium designed to automate the search of people according to their name and age in the dating application Tinder. The operation is based on accessing the tinder page, spoofing the location and in the area to make matches, it searches by matching the name, then allows you to filter by age, if you do not want to put age filter within the extension leaves the age at 0. It is recommended to put the following settings on the tinder page:

- Distance preferences: `<range of 1 to 3 Km>`;
- Show me only people in that range: `True`;
- I am interested in: `<Gender of user to search for>`;
- Age preference: `<age range to quickly discard very low or very high ages>`;

**Recommendations:**

- For geolocation position three profiles in three different points to triangulate the user.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

| Feature                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **‚öôÔ∏è Architecture**    | The system follows a Chrome extension architecture, with separate background and content scripts. The content script is injected into specific webpages, while the background script listens for icon clicks and sends messages to the content script. |
| **üìñ Documentation**   | The documentation is minimal. It provides brief descriptions of the files and their functions, but lacks detailed explanations of the system's functionality.                                                                                          |
| **üîó Dependencies**    | The system relies on the Google Chrome browser and the `chrome.tabs` API for proper functioning. No external libraries or systems are used.                                                                                                            |
| **üß© Modularity**      | The system is well-organized into smaller components, with a separate script for each specific functionality. The scripts can be easily maintained and modified as needed.                                                                             |
| **‚ö°Ô∏è Performance**    | The system's performance largely depends on Chrome's processing capabilities. It does not seem to have any specific optimizations for speed, efficiency, or resource usage.                                                                            |
| **üîê Security**        | The system does not implement any specific security measures to protect user data or maintain functionality. The focus is on automating actions in a specific web application, which doesn't involve significant security concerns.                    |
| **üîÄ Version Control** | The codebase is version controlled using Git. The GitHub repository provides version history, issues, and pull requests to enable collaboration and track changes over time.                                                                           |
| **üîå Integrations**    | The system primarily interacts with the Google Chrome browser through the `chrome.tabs` API. It does not have any direct integrations with other external systems or services.                                                                         |
| **üì∂ Scalability**     | The system's scalability is limited to its use as a Chrome extension. It can potentially be enhanced with additional features or expanded for other web applications, but significant changes would be required for that purpose.                      |

| [background_script.js](https://github.com/j0rd1s3rr4n0/Tinder-Osint-Tool/blob/main/background_script.js) | This code snippet is for a Chrome extension. It toggles the activation of a content script on a specific tab when the extension's icon is clicked. The content script is executed when enabled and deactivated when disabled. The icon changes accordingly to indicate the script's state.                                                                                                                                              |
| [content_script.js](https://github.com/j0rd1s3rr4n0/Tinder-Osint-Tool/blob/main/content_script.js)       | The code allows for clicking on a specific element on a webpage at regular intervals. It also includes functionality to toggle the header, enabling or disabling the script's execution. This code is designed specifically for use with the Google Chrome browser.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [popup.html](https://github.com/j0rd1s3rr4n0/Tinder-Osint-Tool/blob/main/popup.html)                     | This code is a HTML document that creates a webpage for a Tinder AutoLike extension. It contains a title, a button to activate the extension, and a link to the GitHub project. It also includes CSS styling for the button and list items. The JavaScript file "popup_script.js" is linked for additional functionality.                                                                                                               |
| [popup_script.js](https://github.com/j0rd1s3rr4n0/Tinder-Osint-Tool/blob/main/popup_script.js)           | This code listens for the DOMContentLoaded event and adds a click event listener to a button element with the id "toggleButton". When clicked, the code sends a message to the active tab in the Chrome browser using the chrome.tabs API. It also updates the button text based on the response from the content script. If the header is enabled, the button text is "Desactivar", otherwise it is "Activar" and the tab is reloaded. |
